"A collection that maps keys to values, similar to [[Map]], but in which each
 key may be associated with multiple values. You can visualize the contents
 of a multimap either as a map from keys to nonempty collections of values:

 - a → 1, 2
 - b → 3

 ... or as a single \"flattened\" collection of key-value pairs:

 - a → 1
 - a → 2
 - b → 3

 *Important:* although the first interpretation resembles how most multimaps
 are *implemented*, the design of the [[Multimap]] API is based on the
 *second* form. So, using the multimap shown above as an example, the
 [[size]] is `3`, not `2`, and the [[items]] collection is `{ 1, 2, 3 }`,
 not `{ {1, 2}, {3} }`. For those times when the first style is more useful,
 use the multimap's [[asMap]] view (or create a `Map<K, Collection<I>>` in
 the first place)."
